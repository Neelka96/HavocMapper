    `Claudia Beltran`  
    `Neel Agarwal`  

# QUESTIONS FOR GROUP:
    - Is it okay if we remove volcanoes, earthquakes, and mud/landslides from weather-disasters? Or should both versions be used?
    - Should islands be considered as county-equivalents or as islands as a separate grouping?
    - Is the nitty-gritty data field edits okay? Or should those rows just be dropped?

# MAIN TODO:
    - Finish `areaType` cleanup
    - Finalize what disasters are included in project definition
    - Ensure data cleanup method is okay with group
    -

### FEMA Fact-Sheet
FEMA disaster declarations can be emergency declarations (EM), major disaster declarations (DR),  
or fire management assistance declarations (FM). The type of declaration determines the type of  
assistance available.  
1. Emergency declarations (EM)  
    - One of two types of disaster declarations authorized by the Stafford Act  
    - Allows the President to provide supplemental federal disaster assistance  
2. Major disaster declarations (DR)  
    - One of two types of disaster declarations authorized by the Stafford Act  
    - Allows the President to provide supplemental federal disaster assistance  
    - The President may declare a DR if a natural event causes damage that is too  
    severe for state and local governments to respond to  
3. Fire management assistance declarations (FM)  
    - A type of FEMA declaration that can be issued for wildfires and other fires

## Files and Directory Structure  
```  
{repo_name}/
|
|— {main_directory}/
|   |— {input_directory}/
|   |   — test1.csv
|   |   - test2.csv
|   |— main...
```  
This structure ensures all inputs are organized within their respective folders.  
Outputs will be created without additional directory structuring  

[:arrow_up: Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)  

## Expected Results  
1. Updated {main...}
2. New directory structure for `{repo_name}`:
```
{repo_name}/
|
|— {main_directory}/
|   |— {input_directory}/
|   |   — test1.csv
|   |   - test2.csv
|   |- {results_directory}/
|   |   - result1.pdf
|   |   - result2.png
|   |   - result3.jpeg
|   |   - result4.py
|   |   - result5.ipynb
|   |— main... (updated)
```
{New directory paths indicate proper running and exporting of data}
